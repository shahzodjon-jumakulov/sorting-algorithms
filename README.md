# Sorting Algorithms in Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

This project is a simple implementation of various sorting algorithms in Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) using JavaScript. It is intended for understanding and studying different sorting techniques, including:

- Bubble Sort ✔
- Selection Sort ✔
- Insertion Sort ⏳(soon)
- Quick Sort ⏳(soon)
- Counting Sort ⏳(soon)
- Radix Sort ⏳(soon)
- Merge Sort ⏳(soon)

Each algorithm is implemented in JavaScript in a clean and easy-to-read manner, making it useful for learners who want to grasp the fundamentals of sorting algorithms.
